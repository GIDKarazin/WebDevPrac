            <h1> Let's talk about chess </h1>
            <h4> <b> It is believed that the history of chess is at least one and a half thousand years old.  </b> </h4>
            <h4> <blockquote> <pre>
                Chess is a logic board game with chess pieces on a 64-square board, which combines elements of art (including chess composition), science and sports.
                Chess is usually played by two players (called chess players) against each other. It is also possible for one group of chess players to play against
                another or against one player; such games are often referred to as consulting games. In addition, there is a practice of simultaneous game sessions,
                when several opponents play against one strong player, each on a separate board.</pre> </blockquote> </h4>

            <h4> The game is that the players take turns making moves.
                <br> The king moves to an adjacent square vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
                <br> The queen moves to any distance vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
                <em> <hr> The rook moves any distance vertically or horizontally. </em>
                <strike> The bishop moves diagonally to any distance. </strike></h4>
